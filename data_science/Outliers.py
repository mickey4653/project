# # Dealing with Outliers

# Sometimes outliers can mess up an analysis; you usually don't want a handful of data points to skew the overall results. Let's revisit our example of income data, with some random billionaire thrown in:

# In[1]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
import numpy as np

incomes = np.random.normal(27000, 15000, 10000)
incomes = np.append(incomes, [1000000000])
#outliers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(incomes, 50)
plt.show()


# That's not very helpful to look at. One billionaire ended up squeezing everybody else into a single line in my histogram. Plus it skewed my mean income significantly:

# In[2]:


print(incomes.mean())


# It's important to dig into what is causing your outliers, and understand where they are coming from. You also need to think about whether removing them is a valid thing to do, given the spirit of what it is you're trying to analyze. If I know I want to understand more about the incomes of "typical Americans", filtering out billionaires seems like a legitimate thing to do.
# 
# Here's something a little more robust than filtering out billionaires - it filters out anything beyond two standard deviations of the median value in the data set:

# In[4]:


def reject_outliers(data):
    u = np.median(data)
    s = np.std(data)
    filtered = [e for e in data if (u - 2 * s < e < u + 2 * s)]
    #above or below 2 std
    return filtered

filtered = reject_outliers(incomes)

plt.hist(filtered, 50)
plt.show()


# That looks better. And, our mean is more, well, meangingful now as well:

# In[5]:


print(  np.mean(filtered))


# ## Activity

# Instead of a single outlier, add several randomly-generated outliers to the data. Experiment with different values of the multiple of the standard deviation to identify outliers, and see what effect it has on the final results.
